        <ul>
            <li>availability: 20 min ride: 10 out of 10</li>
            <li> parking: 3 or 4 parking spots at the entrance, lot of visitors but space is enough: 10;</li> 
            <li>sightseeings: old mill, some river rocks, bridges: 8;</li>
            <li>social distance: wide walkways, sometimes under the bridges paths become very tight and the path is intended for bycyclist primarily,
                 so be ready for being cautious and watch  bycicle racers:8;</li>
            <li>food: within the park nothing as expected, but around park some fast food facilities operate, so no issues: 10 ;</li>
            <li>space: lots of loans for tanning or picnics: 10;</li>
            <li>acess to waterfront: nice and quiet Goffle Brook River along the path: 10;</li>
            <li>clean and maintained facilities: nothing special, may be present, didn't have a chance to see any restboots, but website says they are present, 
                so formally i give the credit for this spacious and bit long walkway (we walked the entire path and back on feet, about 5 miles - the best exercise 
                imho): 10;</li>
            <li>tickets:free: so 10;</li>
            <li>guards: at the time of the visit no one was in sight but the visitors behaved very friendly: 10;</li>
