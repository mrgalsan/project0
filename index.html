        <h1 class="display-4">Parks Index</h1>
        <p class="lead">This is absolutely private and subjective opinion based on my recent experience 
          that I had with my family when the global health situation dictated 
          to keep face masks on and utilize social distancing rules, but we have gone it through 
          and when the weather has become nice and sunny we undertook several trails and 
          while going into different direction because facilities of such type have significant restrictions 
          in service and availiabilities we found our way out to get the most from having outside walk in nature.
          This emotional experience helped my family to stay healthy by breathing fresh air among trees and bushes. That is why I would like share how was it:
          - the challenge was to find at the eve of quarantine reopening the recreational facilities that are not overcrowded,
           have some space for walking on the grass or on the sand, nice sightseeings, at least one and some other parameters (idealy
           would be great to set 10 parameters, so we can get result as the best of the best will get 100).
  
           So lets go and set the parameters I tried to apply to the parks.
