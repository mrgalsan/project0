        <ul>
            <li>availability: why I picked this beach? Search in internet at the time first beaches reopen was guided by the following thoughts: 
                free beaches will be 100% densed with visitors, then some beaches in closer distance had time limit and group size limit for visit,
                 so I considered trip in 1,5 hours ), this is definitely 0 out of 10.</li>
            <li> parking: despite the beach is about 3 miles long the access to the beach is from one and the only spot, the closest parking
                 around New Wave resort hotel costs 40$, parking in the complex to the right from the hotel costs 35$ but requires monthly pass, 
                 so the affordable option - municipal parking one block back from the boardwalk which costs 20$ and working hours start from 6 am untill 12 am, 
                 which was surpisingly,because i had the situation to drive my uncle's car back home and then return back by Uber to grab my own car 
                 and I didn't have to be in rush, came back at 10 pm and got back home restful. I am going to give 10 out of 10 points for this convinient option.</li> 
            <li>sightseeings: piers, oceanview: so-so, but ocean is in different category, so 5 points;</li>
            <li>social distance: full absence of regret: the beach at June 12 was filled like fish in can, 0 out of 10;</li>
            <li>food: had my own sandwiches but bars and restaurants and ice cream stores present, didn't walk in, so honestly may give only theoretical score
                 for just food facilities presence: 10 ;</li>
            <li>space: big zero;</li>
            <li>acess to waterfront: 10;</li>
            <li>clean and maintained facilities: very clean sand and water(mid june seems still to be very cold), restrooms available; 10;</li>
            <li>tickets: pass for adults 10 $, kids under 13 and seniors for free; another interesting option the payment methods flexible: despite the website 
                says cash or through mobile app (which I used but it requires some time while you input your credentials and scan process by checkout at the boot
                doesn't look easy for employees) also card machines are available before the boots: so 10 of 10);</li>
            <li>guards: present but absoutely not bothering:10;</li>
